I've made a small anaglyph image (you need red-cyan glasses to watch it) of a plastic figure of a knight and a dragon.

<span class="center"><img src="/pics/knight.jpg" width="508" alt=""/></span>

You can read an article about <b>anaglyph images</b> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaglyph_image">Wikipedia</a>. There you'll also find further links to more images.
