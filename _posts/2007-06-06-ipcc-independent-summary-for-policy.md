The [IPCC] has released its 4th assessment report on climate change. Earlier this year I wrote a [critical article] about the mainstream belief of global warming being caused by anthropogenic greenhouse gases and I don't want to do it again anytime soon. However I want to point out to anyone who is interested in this topic that in the meantime the Fraser Institute has released the [Independent summary for policy makers based on the IPCC report][IIPCC] (full report available as [PDF]).
