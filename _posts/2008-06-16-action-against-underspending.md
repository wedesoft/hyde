Are you also notoriously leading your department into problems by underspending on your budget? I am proposing a 3-step solution:

* Send me e-mails with the expected amount of underspending
* I will sum up the stated amounts
* At the end of the fiscal year everyone transfers the money into an escrow acount to finance a new space program

**Update:** So far I have received estimates amounting to Â£60,000.
