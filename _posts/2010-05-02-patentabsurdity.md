The Free Software Foundation has released a short film about software patents called **[Patent Absurdity][3]**. The film features interviews with Eben Moglen, Karen Sandler, Richard Stallman, Jesse Vincent, and other people involved with the Bilski case.

The Bilski case hopefully will help putting a stop to the rampant practise of patenting applications of mathematics, algorithms, and other abstract concepts to real life problems. To freely quote Bruce Perens ([panel discussion at WSIS in Tunis][2]): *Mathematics is a field that is discovered - not invented!*
