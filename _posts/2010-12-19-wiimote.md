I decided to purchase a *Wii Remote* to do some small gaming projects in my spare time. The [Wii][1] has been around for four years now and it usually comes with the [Wii Sports][2] game (I especially enjoyed playing the [bowling][3] game with a group of 4 players). Using a PC running GNU/Linux one can communicate with the Wii Remote using the software packages *wmgui* and *wminput*. I've made a small demonstration video.

The [Wii Remote][6] has a 3-axis accelerometer, an IR camera with a microcontroller producing the coordinates of the 10 brightest dots, and several buttons (arrows, A, B, -, Home, +, 1, and 2). Furthermore there are 4 LEDs and a rumble motor. The device uses the Bluetooth standard for wireless communication.

Note that more recently Nintendo started shipping the [Wii MotionPlus][4] which adds two gyroscopes for measuring the rotational speed along two axes.

**Update:** I released the first version of my [Ruby bindings for the CWiid library][8].

**Update:** I released a [Ruby implementation of Johnny Chung Lee's WiiMote Whiteboard][9]
