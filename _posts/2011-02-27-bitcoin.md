I watched this [interview with Steve Gibson][9] about the Bitcoin crypto currency. The Bitcoin software for online peer-to-peer banking was developed by Satoshi Nakamoto (中本 哲史) and it is available at [bitcoin.org][2].

Basically every block of Bitcoins is a solution of a cryptographic equation. I.e. instead of a scarce metal (such as gold), the currency uses hard computational problems as a *proof of work*. Standard asymmetric encryption is used to digitally sign transactions. The *proof of work* is also used to cryptographically strengthen a chain of transactions in order to prevent double-spending of coins (see [Bitcoin publication][3] for more details). The only known attack requires the attacker to have more computational power at his/her disposal than the entire network of Bitcoin clients.

There's a number of organisations and shops which already accept Bitcoins (see [Bitcoin.it][8] for a list of sites that accept Bitcoins). Furthermore there are several traders which will exchange Bitcoins for US dollars, Euros, and other currencies (there is an [early review of Bitcoin exchanges][7]). According to [Bitcoin Charts][4] the exchange rate currently is around 0.9 USD/BTC

**Update:**

There are concerns that Bitcoin will suffer a [deflationary spiral][10] because the total amount of currency is limited. Of course if this is a real problem one could start a new peer-to-peer currency with a built-in [controlled inflation][11].

**Update:**

Here's a nice video giving a quick introduction to Bitcoin.
