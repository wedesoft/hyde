<h2>Getting Rally Trophy to run on Windows 8</h2>

[Rally Trophy][rtw] by *BugBear Entertainment* and *JoWooD Productions* is the best rally driving simulation I have ever played.
These days it is available as a [free download][rt] on *oldpcgaming.net*. You can run the game in Windows XP compatibility mode.

Note that in order to be able to configure the joystick and keyboard controls, you need to install [Microsoft DirectInput Mapper][di].

There is a code to unlock all cars, tracks, and modes. Just enter **KALJAKOPPA** as your name in the game menu. It will clear the name and then you can enter your normal player name.

I didn't manage to get it to work under *GNU/Linux* using *Wine*. Also I haven't looked into the [modifications][ng] available for it.

Enjoy!

**Update:**

One can get the [modifications][ng] running using the [RTBZFManager.exe][man] tool.
Note that you need to configure the program to run in *Windows XP compatibility mode* otherwise it will silently fail to install game modifications. Also you need to change the settings so that it will export modifications to the data folder. For example:

{% highlight text %}
C:\Program Files (x86)\JoWooD\Rally Trophy\Data
{% endhighlight %}

Now if you for example install the [VW Käfer][beetle] RTP file, it should create a folder named *car_3* next to the *car_3.bzf* file in the *Data\\Cars* folder.

Another distinct looking car is the [Citroën DS3][dm].

In terms of handling the [Peugeot 206][pg] is great fun.

Another really responsive car to drive is the [Porsche 911][po].
