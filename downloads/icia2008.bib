  abstract={Dynamically typed scripting languages have become popular in recent years. Although interpreted languages allow for substantial reduction of software development time, they are often rejected due to performance concerns. In this paper we present an extension for the programming language Ruby, called HornetsEye, which facilitates the development of real-time machine vision algorithms within Ruby. Apart from providing integration of crucial libraries for input and output, HornetsEye provides fast native implementations (compiled code) for a generic set of array operators. Different array operators were compared with equivalent implementations in C++. Not only was it possible to achieve comparable real-time performance, but also to exceed the efficiency of the C++ implementation in several cases. Implementations of several algorithms were given to demonstrate how the array operators can be used to create concise implementations.},
