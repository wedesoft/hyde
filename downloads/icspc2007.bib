  abstract={The use of wavelets in the image processing domain is still in its infancy, and largely associated with image compression. With the advent of the dual-tree hypercomplex wavelet transform (D-HWT) and its improved shift invariance and directional selectivity, applications in other areas of image processing are more conceivable. This paper discusses the problems and solutions in developing the DHWT and its inverse. It also offers a practical implementation of the algorithms involved. The aim of this work is to apply the DHWT in machine vision. Tentative work on a possible new way of feature extraction is presented. The paper shows that 2-D hypercomplex basis wavelets can be used to generate steerable filters which allow rotation as well as translation.},
