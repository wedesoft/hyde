  abstract={Here the design and operation of a novel transmission electron microscope (TEM) triboprobe instrument with real-time vision control for advanced in situ electron microscopy is demonstrated. The NanoLAB triboprobe incorporates a new high stiffness coarse slider design for increased stability and positioning performance. This is linked with an advanced software control system which introduces both new and flexible in situ experimental functional testing modes, plus an automated vision control feedback system. This advancement in instrumentation design unlocks new possibilities of performing a range of new dynamical nanoscale materials tests, including novel friction and fatigue experiments inside the electron microscope.}
